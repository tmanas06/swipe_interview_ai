# Enhanced Scoring System

## Overview
The scoring system has been significantly improved with the following enhancements:

### Key Improvements Made:

1. **Enhanced Keyword Matching**
   - Expanded technical keyword database with 100+ terms
   - Categorized keywords (frontend, backend, general, architecture)
   - Weighted scoring system for different keyword categories
   - Architecture keywords weighted 1.5x, backend 1.3x, frontend 1.2x

2. **Advanced Quality Metrics**
   - **Completeness**: Checks for explanations, examples, details, and technical terms
   - **Clarity**: Evaluates sentence structure, connectors, and readability
   - **Technical Depth**: Assesses complexity based on matched categories and advanced concepts
   - **Relevance**: Measures answer relevance to the question asked

3. **Improved Scoring Algorithm**
   - Multi-factor scoring system (length, word count, sentence structure, keywords, quality metrics)
   - Better difficulty scaling with bonuses for hard questions with good technical depth
   - More nuanced scoring ranges and thresholds

4. **Enhanced Feedback Generation**
   - Specific, actionable feedback based on quality metrics
   - Positive reinforcement for covering multiple technical areas
   - Targeted suggestions for improvement
   - Context-aware recommendations based on difficulty level

5. **Better AI Integration**
   - Enhanced prompts for AI-powered scoring with detailed evaluation criteria
   - Comprehensive summary generation with structured assessment
   - Fallback to improved algorithm when AI is unavailable

### Test the Enhanced System:
```bash
node test-enhanced-scoring.js
```

### Scoring Criteria:
- **Technical Accuracy (25%)**: Correctness of technical concepts
- **Completeness (25%)**: How well the answer addresses the question
- **Clarity & Communication (20%)**: How clearly the answer is presented
- **Depth & Detail (20%)**: Level of technical detail and examples
- **Relevance (10%)**: How directly the answer relates to the question

### Score Ranges:
- **9-10**: Exceptional technical expertise, comprehensive coverage
- **7-8**: Strong technical knowledge, good coverage
- **5-6**: Solid technical understanding, adequate coverage
- **3-4**: Basic technical knowledge, incomplete coverage
- **1-2**: Limited technical understanding, poor coverage
